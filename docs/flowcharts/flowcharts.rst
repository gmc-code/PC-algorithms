Flowcharts
==========================

| A flowchart is a visual diagram that illustrates the logical sequence of steps in an algorithm.
| Different shapes and colors are used to represent specific instructions or decisions.

The fundamental components of a flowchart include:

- **Start and End points** marking the start and end of the algorithm
- **Data input**
- **Output of results**
- **Processes** such as assignments, calculations
- **Selection diamonds** for a decision that determine the next path in the workflow
- **Lines with Arrows** indicating the order in which steps are carried out, especially for loops.
