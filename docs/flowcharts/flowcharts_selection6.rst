Flowcharts Classify Triangles by Sides
=================================================

| Logical operators are used to combine conditions in decision-making.

   * - Operator
     - Name
     - Description
   * - AND
     - Logical AND
     - True only if both conditions are true
   * - OR
     - Logical OR
     - True if at least one condition is true
   * - NOT
     - Logical NOT
     - Reverses the truth value (true → false)

| The flowchart below checks to see if a triangle has all sides equal, or just 2 sides equal, and classifies it accordingly.

    #. In the pseudocode, in the IF statement above, which logical operator is used to see if all 3 sides are of equal length?
    #. In the pseudocode, in the ELSEIF statement above, what is the most number of sides that can be equal?

            .. tab-item:: Q1

                In the pseudocode, in the IF statement above, which logical operator is used to see if all 3 sides are of equal length?

                '' code-block:: none

                    AND

            .. tab-item:: Q2

                In the pseudocode, in the ELSEIF statement above, what is the most number of sides that can be equal?

                '' code-block:: none

                    2 sides, since 3 sides has been covered in the IF statement and decided to be false.
