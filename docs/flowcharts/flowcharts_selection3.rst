Flowcharts Positive Numbers
=================================================

| The pseudocode below checks to see whether a number is positive or not.

.. code-block:: none

    ALGORITHM positiveOrNot()

    BEGIN
        INPUT number
        IF number > 0 THEN
            PRINT number + " is positive."
        ELSE
            PRINT number + " is not positive."
        ENDIF
    END


| The new shape in the flowchart (number > 0?), is for a decision, which tests a condition and answers True (Yes) or False (No).
| These decisions are written on each branch line.
