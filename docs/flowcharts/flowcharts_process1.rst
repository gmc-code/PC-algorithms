| Process - Area of a rectangle

.. code-block:: none

    ALGORITHM rectangleArea()

    BEGIN
        INPUT l, w
        A  ←  l * w
        PRINT A
    END


| The new shape in the flowchart (Compute A = l x w), is for a process, such as calculating the value of a variable using a formula and storing it for later use.
| When calculating the area, the value is put in the variable, A. This is known as assignment. A value is assigned to the variable, A.
``A  ←  l * w`` can be read out as "A gets l times w"
